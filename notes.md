## Day 1

- We met on zoom at 2pm and spoke a bit about what we think went well about our first group projects.

- The feedback was that some people felt they planned too much and some people were happy with the level of planning.

- We also discussed assigning roles.

- As a result we decided to go through the project and work out the interface based on user stories.

- We mapped this on Adobe Illustrator

- Once this was done we set up a Trello board with the User Stories and To-Do list.

- Decided to split up work front-end and back-end, since this would allow us to work across the project without minimal overlap

- Emma then set up the GitHub repo

- Determined the MVP:
  * It's an app that displays notes, you can add extra notes, see full previous notes.
  * All front-end project.
  * All css'd and looking good.

* Daily plan: Meet up at 2pm for stand-up

* Pair 1 -  Max and Emma
  • Front-End

* Pair 2 - Sha and Inbar
 • Back-End


 ## Day 2
- We met at 2pm to go over what the pairs had done the previous day

- We merged the branches from yesterday's pairs into the master branch

- Added additional to-do items based on user stories and 'missing features' noticed during yesterday's work (e.g. delete option)

- Selected priority tasks from to-do list:
  * Add delete feature (in HTML and in class)
  * Connect model to view using interface
  * Turn tests into testing library

- Met at 5pm discussed what's done and merged
